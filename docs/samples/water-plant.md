![water plant program](../images/generated/sample_more_water_please!.png){:class="sample"}

This program uses two Jacdac modules:

-   a soil moisture sensor to detect the moisture level in soil
-   a relay that controls a water pump

The program turns on the relay to the water pump when the soil moisture level is low (1)
and turns it off when the soil moisture level is higher (3).
